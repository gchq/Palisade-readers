/**
 * The resource service is the Palisade component that determines what resources are available that meet a specific
 * (type of) request and how they should be accessed. This interface details several methods for obtaining a list of
 * resources, e.g. by type or by data format. The methods of this service all return {@link Iterator}s which link a valid
 * {@link LeafResource} with a {@link ConnectionDetail} object. The ${@link ConnectionDetail} objects contain
 * information on how to set up a connection to retrieve a particular resource. Implementations of this service do not
 * deal with the filtering or application of security policy to the resources. Therefore, a result returned from a
 * method call on this interface doesn't guarantee that the user will be allowed to access it by policy. Other
 * components of the Palisade system will enforce the necessary policy controls to prevent access to resources by users
 * without the necessary access rights.
 * Implementation note: None of the ${@code getResourcesByXXX} methods in this class will return in error if there
 * don't happen to be any resources that do not match a request, instead they will simply return empty ${@link Iterator}
 * instances.
